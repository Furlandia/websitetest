Wow! We're still six months from the convention, but we've already managed to
break a record for Furlandia 2017 Dealers' Den applications!

We would love to include everyone who has applied to exhibit with us for 2017.
As it stands, we already have almost twice as many requests for dealer space
as we have tables!

Although we're thrilled by your enthusiasm and interest, we've had to make the
tough decision to close our Dealer registration for 2017 earlier than expected.
Thank you so much to all of the vendors who want to be part of our great
adventure! The new deadline for Dealers' Den applications is **Sunday, December
4 at 11:59:59 PM PST**.

We know some of you will be disappointed, but remember that we will be
introducing an Artist Alley in 2017, so don't give up hope! Also, if you apply
before our new cut-off, we'll add you to a wait list in case someone cancels or
can't make it.

We'll be reaching out to all applicants over the next two weeks to let you know
whether you were selected and with directions on what to do next. Looking
forward to seeing you at *Furlandia 2017: Age of Prosperity!*
