              Rope Bondage has a long and storied history, depending on whom you ask. Knowing where rope techniques come from can give you a wonderful idea of traditional methods and styles of rope bondage. Unfortunately, most of the time that history does not translate into real, practical skills you can use to bring Rope Bondage skills into your regular play. This class and its instructor, Geoffrey Quick, brings a more practical approach to teaching rope skills.

              Fur culture has a fine appreciation for visual art of all kinds. Furries often will not balk at spending hundreds of dollars for character art from known artists. Writers however, have a much harder challenge finding people willing to pay appropriate value for their work. Why is this? This panel is an examination of writing as an art form, and why it seems to be so tough to make money in the current writing market.

          description: >
              Bondage art and the furry fandom go hand-in-hand. From leashes and collars to full harnesses and ropework bondage features heavily in furry artwork and writing. Furs offer the unique opportunity to draw or write adult content for people with potentially vastly different body shapes, types and musculature. It's always good to keep in mind how the human body works when dealing with bondage, so that your portrayal of bondage doesn't have folks scratching their heads and declaring "I just don't see how that is physically possible."
