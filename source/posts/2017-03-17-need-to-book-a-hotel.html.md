Need to book a hotel for Furlandia? We've just added two new hotels to our list!

For the first time in our history, we've managed to sell out of our main
convention hotel! But don't worry &mdash; we've been working hard behind
the scenes and our wonderful hotel team have negotiated special rates for
Furlandia attendees at two more hotels: the **Hampton Inn Portland-Airport**
and **Aloft Portland Airport at Cascade Station**!

Both hotels are super-close to our convention too, so you won't have to worry
about missing out on any of the fun. The **Hampton Inn Portland-Airport**
is right next door to our main convention hotel, while the **Aloft Portland
Airport at Cascade Station** is just a short distance away. Even though
it's a short walk or drive away, you'll be pleased to know that there's
a complimentary shuttle service between the **Aloft Portland Airport at
Cascade Station** and the **Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel**!

To find out more about both hotels, visit our
<a href="hotel.html" target="_blank">hotel page</a>,
where you'll find room rates, a list of amenities for each hotel, and a direct
booking link for our preferred rates.

See you soon!
