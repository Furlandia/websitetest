  Every year at Furlandia we invite some of the most celebrated members of our
  community to be our official Guests of Honor. This year, thanks to our
  expanding attendance figures, we're honored to have six special guests, some
  local to the Portland area and others who hail from further away.
  
  Throughout the weekend, you'll have a chance to meet and talk with our Guests
  of Honor, as well as attend the various panels, discussions, and performances
  they'll be putting on. And if you're a Patron or Sponsor, you'll have even
  more chance of meeting our guests at our special patron- and sponsor-only
  events!

    bio: |
      Originally born in the Netherlands, Maggie has been working as a
      professional artist for over ten years under the name Etuix (pronounced
      "E-Twix", like the candy!) Maggie got her start as an artist drawing
      Neopets. Her joy of drawing cute furry animals naturally led her to the
      furry fandom after being introduced to it by a friend in early 2007.

      Predominantly a digital artist, she produces her artwork using a Wacom
      Cintiq and Adobe Photoshop. She creates traditional artwork exclusively at
      conventions.

      Maggie has been a dealer at west coast furry conventions since 2013.

      When not working on art, she loves reading, anime, hiking, and video
      games. She currently lives in Portland, OR with her husband and their two
      Bernese mountain dogs, Enzo and Ender.

      If you see her, come say hi!

      Temperance is a Fursuit maker from Canada. She has been making costumes
      for 15 years. Originally a comic book artist, she moved into cosplay
      and costume making when she found the long hours sitting at a drawing
      desk were becoming too taxing. She discovered the furry fandom and
      fursuits while attending a local comic convention in 2008 and spotted
      a furry walking the halls. After some research online she began making
      some of those “fun animal costumes” and has been making fursuits
      since then. Her works have won various awards at masquerades and costume
      competitions including San Diego Comic con and Dragon Con. Her work was
      also featured in a music video for the Australian band "DZ Deathrays".

      Fox Amoore is a professional composer, pianist and keyboardist. He has
      performed in various places, from the Albert Hall, to the Cavern Club in
      Liverpool, Vancouver, the Gold Coast of Australia, and many places in

      works.

      His music mainly consists of the New-Age and Orchestral styles with a strong
      piano lead. However, he has also performed and composed in a number of other
      styles, including jazz and to a lesser extent electronica / modern dance.

      He has performed and composed for numerous acts and media. As a composer, he
      has worked for Supervillain Studios with their Nintendo Wii production
      *Order Up!* He has also composed for Gamer Tonight, an acclaimed comedy
      video game parody show, as well as various media and commerial products.

      Fox has been performing at furry conventions for many years, and has taken
      part in all sorts of interesting collaborations in that time. He's also one
      half of the furry duet known as Foxes and Peppers.

      Pepper has been performing music for 10 years, 5 of which were spent in the
      furry fandom. Since 2011 Pepper has played in stairwells, hotel rooms, panel
      rooms, and main event halls from Pittsburgh to San Jose. This wil be
      Pepper's first show in Portland, and his first time setting foot in Oregon.
      He has, however, watched the documentary "Portlandia", so he feels prepared.

      Pepper is primarily a singer, but also playes guitar and messes around with
      a looper. At the show you'll hear tons of looping madness. We start with
      something simple, and over the course of a couple of minutes, a whole band's
      sound is created with just a guy and a little box. It's pretty neat.

      We hope you'll come and check out one of Pepper's shows or panels. He's a
      unique performer and we think you'll have a good time.

      Becoming entranced with the dirty house sounds of the mid 2000s,
      the rough and euphoric sounds of classic hardstyle in 2009, and
      later the thumping jump/tek and freestyle beats of the current day,
      DJ Jumpiicat has always had a taste for something different. Honing
      his skills in recent years, he's done varying gigs ranging from
      basketball halftime shows, to weddings, to barbeques and beyond,
      typically playing pop/house and indie dance hits. On the mainstage
      however, Jumpiicat brings his own unique stylings of freestyle hard
      dance, old to new school, euphoric and raw. Anything but a one-act show,
      his musical experience also extends to classical and jazz performance,
      as well as industrial/musical theatre sound engineering.
