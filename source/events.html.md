Standard events

Now that our schedule is finalized, you can check out when and where to find the
events you are most looking forward to, including our Major Events such as:

### Dances

The mainstay of any convention evening, you know we've got you covered when it comes to things you can shake your tail to!

As usual, we'll have dances on Friday and Saturday night. In keeping with past years and standard furcon operating procedure, we'll have dedicated fursuit dance times so those in fursuit can strut their stuff in safety.

DJ applications are still open, so if you're interested in playing a set, check out the <a href="dj-applications.html" target="_blank">DJ applications page</a> for details on how you can submit your best mixes for consideration.

### Dance Competition

There will be one of these too!

All applicants must submit their music prior to May 6, 2016.

Rules can be found on the <a href="dance-comp.html" target="_blank">Dance Competition Rules</a> page.

### Fursuit Parade

What kind of furry convention doesn't have a fursuit parade?
Not us, that's for sure. Last year we had 142 fursuits in our parade; that's one of every five attendees!
When the fursuiters line up this year to strut their stuff, will YOU be among them?

### Fursuit Games

With all the fursuiters who show up, we'll just have to find something fun for them to do!

Come join the fun in the Main Theatre (Mt. Hood) on Sunday, May 28 from 10:00am to 12:00pm!
