conduct: |
  Like any convention, the way our attendees treat the hotel reflects the
  convention itself. And that means if our attendees don't respect the hotel,
  we won't be welcomed back. To ensure that doesn't happen, we ask that all
  guests use some basic common sense during their stay at the hotel and treat
  all staff, guests, and convention attendees with respect and dignity, as well
  as ensuring that all hotel and convention property is treated with an equal
  amount of respect.

  In short:

  * Be courteous to housekeeping, clean up after yourself, and remember to tip!
  * Treat the hotel and its staff with respect. Do not break anything or cause
    damage to hotel property.
  * Obey the hotel's no-smoking and no-vaping policy. Smoke only in designated
    outside areas, which are clearly marked. If you smoke in or damage your room,
    you'll be charged for it.
  * Do not bring illegal substances or engage in illegal activities on hotel
    grounds or in convention space.
  * Do not bring weapons of any kind onto hotel grounds or into convention
    space.

  Simply put, we're asking you to follow standard hotel rules. Here at
  Furlandia, we view these rules as mandatory, not optional. If you're removed
  from the property or you violate hotel rules, you'll lose your convention
  membership.
