About Furlandia
===============

Furlandia is Portland's premier anthropomorphic arts convention, held each year
over Memorial Day weekend in Portland, Oregon. We've grown quickly since our
beginning in 2013; in 2016 we welcomed 763 attendees to the Sheraton Portland
Airport hotel, our venue since 2014. That makes us the 22nd largest furry
convention in the world.

Furlandia also raises money for local and national charities. At last year's
convention, we raised over $1000 for Animal Aid PDX. Even after our convention
is over, many of our attendees continue to help out at charity events across the
country, donating money or performances.

What happens at Furlandia? Lots of fun! From art shows to
<a href="events.html" target="_blank">panels</a>, <a href="dance-comp.html" target="_blank">dance competitions</a> to karaoke,
nightly dances, and our fursuit parade, Furlandia is a family-friendly
convention that everyone can enjoy. We have a <a href="dealers.html" target="_blank">Dealers' Den</a>
where attendees can buy or commission art, as well as our fursuit games and a
<a href="showcase.html" target="_blank">variety showcase</a> that's fun for all!

After curfew, we also offer a select number of adults-only panels with more
mature themes in a restricted section of the hotel.

Furlandia has a different theme each year, from <a href="/2015/" target="_blank">Adventure on the High Seas</a> to <a href="/2016/" target="_blank">The Age of Industry</a>, and prizes are awarded for the
best thematic costumes. Our theme for 2017 is **1929: The Age of Prosperity!**
So dust off your spats, brush up on your Charleston, and come join the fun!
