    - name: Portlandia
      address: "1120 SW 5th Ave"

        The star of the city has to be the statue of *Portlandia*, installed in 1985
        above the west entrance of the Portland Building (1120 SW 5th Ave).
        The huge statue is the 2nd-largest copper repouss&#233; statue in the world
        after the Statue of Liberty. The easiest way to get there is to take the
        southbound MAX to SW Jefferson and SW 5th Ave. For the best view, cross
        the street to the Standard Plaza Building and ride the elevator up one
        floor.
        The statue is based on the seal of the city of Portland, and
        both the architect Michael Graves and the sculptor Raymond Kaskey won
        awards for the Portland Building and its "Copper Goddess", respectively.

    - name: Big Pink
      address: "111 SW 5th Ave"
      image: travel/big-pink.png
      description: |
        The most striking features of the U.S. Bancorp Tower,
        affectionately referred to by the locals as "Big Pink", are its
        unusual shape and color. Because of the street grid, the tower features no
        right angles in its footprint, which makes it
        look either very slender or rather wide depending upon your viewing
        angle. The pink granite covering the building was quarried in Spain,
        and the glass used for the windows is also pink when viewed from outside
        because of its semi-transparent coating of copper and silver.
        Both the windows and the surrounding granite may appear darker or lighter
        depending upon the time of day.

        <img class="travel-img" src="img/travel/umbrella-man.png" alt="Allow Me (Umbrella Man)">

        Also known as *Portland's living room*, Pioneer Square is a public
        space occupying a full 40,000-square-foot city block in the center
        of downtown Portland. One of the more recognized pieces of public
        art in Portland is Seward Johnson's *Allow Me*, referred to by the
        locals as *Umbrella Man*. The bronze statue of a man in a business
        suit holding an umbrella is on the south side of the square, just above
        the amphitheater.

        <a href="img/travel/weather-machine.png" target="_blank">*Weather Machine*</a>
        is a 33 foot (10 m) tall metal column topped with a
        large silver orb, installed in August 1988. Light bulbs on the side of
        the machine light up progressively as the temperature increases, and
        at noon each day the next day's weather forecast is announced with a
        fanfare of trumpets, flashing lights, and a spray of mist. The orb opens
        to reveal one of the following:

        * a golden leaf sun, for a clear day;
        * a silver great blue heron, to forecast a drizzly, misty, or overcast day;
        * an open-mouthed copper dragon, when storms are forecast.

        Dozens of all-ages events are held at the square each year, including free shows
        during spring and summer sponsored by local businesses.
        In 2006, the square was the site of
        an all-city pillow fight, and later an all-city slumber party. Pioneer
        Courthouse Square is also a venue for speeches, political demonstrations,
        rallies and vigils. On your visit to the Square, check out the paving
        bricks&mdash;they bear the names of the donors who contributed to the
        remodel of the site.
