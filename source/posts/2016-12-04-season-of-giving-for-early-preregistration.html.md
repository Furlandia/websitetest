Fellow Furlandians!

The early bird gets the worm, and the early fur gets some extra goodies!

Believe it or not, we're now just six months away from our next con, and we've
already got lots of eager attendees registered to join us in the fun world of
*Furlandia 1929: Age of Prosperity!*

Aside from all the great [guests of honor](goh.html) we've got lined up this
year, including Foxes and Peppers, Etuix, Onnanoko, Temperance (Komickrazi) and
DJ Jumpiicat, we've got a whole bunch of great events already scheduled that you
won't want to miss!

There's our inaugural Artists' Alley, some great panels for first-time attendees
and veterans alike, as well as our very first MotoFur meetup. That's in addition
to our usual fursuit parade, Dealers' Den and dances, as well as two headline
concerts from Fox Amoore and Pepper Coyote!


And because it's the season of giving, we've decided to give attendees who
register and pay for their membership before **11:59:59 PM PST on December 31,
2016** a free decal for being so well organized about their con attendance.
You'll also be automatically entered into a prize drawing to win an
extra-special secret early-bird prize, which will be drawn by one of our Guests
of Honor live at opening ceremonies!

So what are you waiting for? Register and pay for your attendance in full by
**December 31, 2016 11:59:59 PM PST** in order to enter the drawing!
