Dear Furlandians!

It's going to be super hot this coming weekend, with sunny skies and
temperatures into the low- to mid-80s &deg;F.

Our convention space and hotels are air conditioned, but we know that some
of you like to head outside and have fun in the sun! This means we're asking
all of you to ensure that you bring adequate sun screen and protection, as
well as a reusable water bottle you can keep with you at all times. There
are water fountains in the Mt. Hood foyer, outside of the main theatre,
and in the corridor west of registration in the Garden foyer, so you can
easily keep your bottle topped off!

Keeping hydrated will ensure you enjoy the convention and avoid heat stroke.
This is especially important for those of you who are fursuiting at con.
Your body loses a lot of water while in a fursuit, and hot weather won't help.
If you have a heat-related medical emergency, the paramedics will be saving you,
not your fursuit!

Plan ahead, drink lots, and here's to a fun, safe convention!
