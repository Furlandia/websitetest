questions:
    - Q: Where is the con?
      A: The convention is being held at the <a href="hotel.html" target="_blank">Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel</a> in Portland, Oregon, USA.

    - Q: Is this the same hotel as last year?
      A: Yes, and they are fantastic! The staff really enjoy the furries, and sometimes they even wear ears!

    - Q: What is the official hashtag?
      A: You can use <a href="https://www.twitter.com/hashtag/FL2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#FL2017</a> or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/hashtag/Furlandia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Furlandia</a>.

    #    * Weasyl : https://www.weasyl.com/~furlandia.

    - Q: Is there a deposit when reserving the hotel room?
      A: There is no up-front deposit when reserving if you use a credit or debit card to hold the room, and the hotelâ€™s cancellation policy is rather generous as well.

    - Q: How much is parking?
      A: Free! W00t!

    - Q: And wi-fi?
      A: Also free. Both in event spaces and guest rooms.

    - Q: Can I sleep in the hotel parking lot/lobby/pool/etc?
      A: No. The only place on hotel property you are allowed to rest your weary head is in a guest room.

    - Q: Why should I stay at the hotel?
      A: We hear this a lot from locals. We know that saving money is nice, but if you don't stay at the hotel you might miss out on some events as well as from a social standpoint. Some of the really fun stuff happens after the daylight hours, and being able to have a safe and convenient space to relax or rest makes everything better. It also makes the whole event feel much less hectic and time-constrained. Besides all that every room booked is a huge help to us. In order to make each year financially viable, we commit to booking a certain number of rooms (a room block); this brings down the cost of hosting the con (which keeps membership prices reasonable). If we can't do that, we don't survive.

    - Q: How can I find room and rideshares?
      A: The best way to find a room and ride-share for Furlandia is through the third-party site <a href="https://www.conroomies.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConRoomies</a>, or by making a post on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Furlandia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a>.

    - Q: Will you mail me my badge/ticket?
      A: No, badges are only able to be picked up at the time of the convention at the Registration desk.

    - Q: I'm thinking about joining the staff/volunteering.
      A: That's wonderful! The more the merrier! Apart from being a part of making this wonderful convention a better event, our staff/volunteers can also earn a discounted or even free membership for next year! But for a lot of us it's much more than that. It can be a lot of fun! For those who really get involved you feel like you are part of something big, along with the rest of your con staff family. We feel an enormous sense of satisfaction once such a significant undertaking comes together. Nothing quite like it! Of course there are additional goodies and incentives&hellip; Just click on <a href="volunteer.html" target="_blank">Volunteer</a> to get started, or send an email to [staffing@furlandia.org](mailto:staffing@furlandia.org).

    - Q: Can I volunteer at con?
      A: While we love having people tell us they want to volunteer before the convention, we also have Gopher volunteers at the con. Gophers can end up doing a variety of things as needed, but largely they assist with small errands as required by Con Ops and logistics.

    - Q: Can I attend Staff/Con Planning meetings even if I am not on staff?
      A: Our meetings are open to the public. Dates and locations are posted <a href="meetings.html" target="_blank">here</a>. All staff are encouraged to attend meetings, and while they are not mandatory it is expected that you attend once every other meeting.
 
    - Q: I know that marijuana is legal in Oregon. Can I smoke it at Furlandia?
      A: No. While Marijuana has been legalized for recreational use in Oregon the Airport Sheraton is on Federal land, and so therefore the policy is to not allow smoking or vaping or any other use of marijuana on the premises. Breaking this policy is grounds for removal from the hotel, which includes an automatic forfeiture of your convention membership. Tobacco may be smoked or vaped outside the hotel in designated areas.
 
    - Q: What is your badging policy?
      A: At Furlandia, you must display your current-year membership badge to enter convention space. The badges are color-coded for easy recognition.
