*Furlandia 1929: Age of Prosperity!* is almost upon us! 

Pre-registration closes on **April 30, 2017 at 11:59:59 PM PDT**. If you
haven't registered and paid in full by that time:

* The cost of the Attending membership will become the at-convention rate of
  **$45**.
* Due to high demand, Sponsor and Patron upgrades cannot be sold at the
  convention.
* All additional items, such as T-shirts and charity donations, will be cleared
  from your cart. You will need to purchase these items individually at the
  convention.

Act now to confirm your membership at the pre-registration rate!
