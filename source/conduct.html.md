##Code of Conduct

###General Conduct

Please use common sense and respect others’ right to enjoy the event. Remember that any activity 
which is illegal by municipal, county, state, or Federal statute, law, or regulation outside the 
event is illegal during the event. Event staff will ask you to stop any observed illegal activity. 
If the illegal activity continues or is particularly dangerous or offensive, event staff will report 
this activity to hotel security and other proper authorities. While in public or in convention spaces, 
attendees are expected to maintain a “PG-13” standard of conduct. Repeat offenders may have their 
membership suspended or even revoked. Please also note that the event staff retains the right to deny 
entry to anyone and that you can be asked to leave at any time without a warning.

###Badging Policy

Furlandia ensures that each member gets both a lanyard and at least one type of membership badge. 
Your proof of membership is defined as your current year badge issued to you by the convention, and 
must be clearly visibly displayed at all times during our event. Event staff can request to see proof 
of membership at any time. Event staff may deny you access to events or event space if you do not have 
proof of membership. All Furlandia-issued badges remain the property of RAIn for the duration of the 
convention and must be surrendered upon request.

###Identification policy

As previously mentioned, all attendees (in and out of costume) are required to have their con badge 
clearly visible at all times while in event space. The event badge must not be obscured by custom badges, 
and must remain outward facing so the badge color code and name are visible.
Occasionally the hotel staff will ask for costumers to "lift your head" when ordering food, requesting 
services or communicating with hotel staff. The hotel policy regarding costumes is no head coverings, 
so the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel is being very generous by allowing costumers, fursuiters and others. 
Please be courteous when interacting with hotel staff and do as they request. If you have a conflict with a 
hotel staff member, please remove yourself from the situation and seek a Furlandia staff member for assistance. 
Do NOT antagonize the hotel staff, they are our friends and allies.

###Media Policy

As per our policy, the staff has decided not to allow ANY media coverage at the event without PRIOR approval. 
Attendees purchasing a membership agree not to act as media agents in any way, shape, or form while attending 
our event. Making photographic, audio, or video recordings of any convention event for investigative or 
commercial purposes is strictly forbidden.

###Hotel

As a convention attendee, you are a guest of the hotel and must abide by the hotel’s rules and policies 
whenever you are on the premises. If you are unsure if something is allowed, Hotel Front Desk will be able 
to assist you. This is NOT a case of “it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission”. If you are 
expelled from the hotel for violation of their rules, you immediately forfeit your event membership and 
must surrender your badge, and there will be no refund. You are personally responsible for any damage you 
or your minor children cause to hotel property. The event space and public spaces of the hotel may not be 
used as sleeping areas.

###Dress code

Hotel dress code is that all visitors to the hotel in common areas (e.g. lobby and hotel corridors) must 
be covered from shoulders to thighs. The swimming pool area is the only exception to this rule. Violations 
of this policy will result in no access to the event space. Also, please remember that anything that would 
be considered “fetish gear” by the mainstream public is also discouraged in public spaces. If you aren’t 
sure about your dress, please ask a staff member for guidance.

###No shoe policy

Hotel policy is shoes are required while in common areas (e.g. lobby, ground floor corridors). No shoes, 
no service—no access to the event space.

###Harassment and Assault

Harassment is defined as any behavior that alarms or intentionally annoys another person. This includes 
making any unwanted physical contact, following someone around a public area without a legitimate reason, 
or threatening to physically attack someone. Please remember that if you approach someone and they tell 
you “no” or to leave them alone, your business with them is done. If you do not leave them alone as they 
have requested, your actions may be grounds for a complaint of harassment. If you feel that you are being 
harassed, or you have been assaulted, please report the matter immediately to event staff. This is also 
the place to note that COSTUME IS NOT CONSENT. Even if someone is dressed in an alluring or provocative 
manner, it is NOT an implied invitation to touch, grab, or make inappropriate or unwelcome comments.

###Weapons

Bladed weapons (such as daggers or swords) and toy firearms are acceptable provided they have been 
peace-bonded such that they clearly cannot be drawn. Toy firearms need to have an orange tip on the 
barrel if they are even remotely realistic-looking. Water guns, Silly String-type products, and 
projectile weapons of any kind are NOT acceptable due to the potential for damage to costumes, hotel 
property, etc. “If it is drawn, you’re gone”. Any drawing, displaying, brandishing, or making any 
threatening gesture with any weapon or firearm, both real and replica, shall be cause for immediate 
expulsion from the event. The only exception to this shall be at a prearranged demonstration or event 
with the permission of the event coordinators, or when posing for pictures (please use your best judgement).

###Under-age Members

Minors under the age of 14 shall be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or an adult designated as 
responsible for them by their parent or guardian at all times. For minors from age of 14 to 17, there 
must be a responsible adult on site and able to be contacted at all times. All minors under the age of 
17 must have a parent or legal guardian sign a waiver, <a href="files/FL2017_parent_form.pdf" target="_blank">available here</a>.

###Minor Curfew
 
All attendees under the age of 18 MUST be out of the St. Helen’s area by 9 PM. Curfew for minors in the 
other areas of the event space is midnight.

###Violations and Appeals

Violations of these policies will be handled by event staff as deemed appropriate by staff. Violators 
will be asked to cease and desist. Violators may have their membership suspended, revoked, or up to a 
390 day ban placed. Two members of the executive committee (one of whom must be the Convention Chair or Vice-Chair) 
are required in order to revoke a membership. Membership revocations are final, however a ban may be 
appealed to the RAIn Board of Directors. Decisions made by the majority of Board of Directors are final.
