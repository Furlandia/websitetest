Two days to go and we are super-excited!

If you are pre-registered and pre-paid, all you have to do is bring your signed AUP Form and valid photo ID to Registration in the Garden foyer to pick up your badge.

Forgot to print your AUP Form? Didn't make the pre-registration deadline? Don't worry! We will have kiosks set up in the Garden foyer for you to register at-con or re-print your AUP Form.

At-con prices are as follows:

* Full weekend: **$45**
* Friday only: **$20**
* Saturday only: **$20**
* Sunday only: **$15**

If you are a dealer, set up begins in Mt. Adams at 6pm Thursday evening. Touch base with either Bijoux or Demi (or Ops) and we will help you get your badges.

Looking forward to seeing your friendly furry faces on Friday!!
